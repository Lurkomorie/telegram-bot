# Miniapp Design Update - Complete

## Overview

Updated the miniapp design and fixed story selection functionality as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Character Cards Design (`PersonasGallery`)

#### Visual Changes:

- ✅ **Removed badge display** - Badges no longer shown on cards
- ✅ **Full card image** - Image now fills entire card with `position: absolute`
- ✅ **Dark translucent overlay** - Info section has `rgba(10, 10, 10, 0.75)` background with backdrop blur
- ✅ **Use smallDescription** - Changed from `description` to `smallDescription` field
- ✅ **Hover scale effect** - Cards now scale to `1.05` on hover

#### Files Modified:

- `miniapp/src/components/PersonasGallery.jsx` - Updated component structure
- `miniapp/src/components/PersonasGallery.css` - Updated styling with new layout

### 2. Character Stories Design (`HistorySelection`)

#### Visual Changes:

- ✅ **Reduced padding** - Info block padding reduced from `18px` to `12px`
- ✅ **Removed all text** - Removed description and greeting text
- ✅ **Use smallDescription only** - Only displays `smallDescription` field
- ✅ **Clickable card** - Made entire card clickable (removed separate button)

#### Files Modified:

- `miniapp/src/components/HistorySelection.jsx` - Simplified component
- `miniapp/src/components/HistorySelection.css` - Removed unused button and text styles

### 3. Story Selection Functionality

#### Backend Changes (`app/api/miniapp.py`):

- ✅ **Delete existing chat** - When selecting a story, existing chat is now deleted to start fresh
- ✅ **Remove system messages** - All messages (including system messages) are deleted from DB when chat is deleted
- ✅ **Clear refresh button** - Removes refresh button from previous image before deleting chat
- ✅ **Improved ordering** - Clears UI elements before deleting chat to avoid errors

#### Behavior:

- ✅ **Immediate close** - Frontend already implemented `WebApp.close()` on success
- ✅ **Start story** - Creates new chat with selected history and sends greeting immediately
- ✅ **Fresh start** - All previous chat data is cleared

### 4. API Updates

#### Data Structure Changes:

- ✅ **Added smallDescription to personas** - `/api/miniapp/personas` now returns `smallDescription` field
- ✅ **Added smallDescription to histories** - `/api/miniapp/personas/{id}/histories` now returns `smallDescription` field
- ✅ **CamelCase transformation** - Backend transforms snake_case to camelCase for frontend

#### Files Modified:

- `app/api/miniapp.py` - Updated both personas and histories endpoints

## Technical Details

### CSS Changes

- Changed card layout from nested containers to absolute positioning
- Info overlay now positioned at bottom of card with translucent background

- Removed badge positioning styles

### React Changes
